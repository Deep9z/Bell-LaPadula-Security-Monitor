# Bell-LaPadula-Security-Monitor
A system that has BLP reference monitor to determine how subject and objects may interact with each other. 

The program determines the security level for each subject and object, which is given in a seperate file that the program reads. It then determines if the interaction that the user requests and is valid. If it is, it allows it. If it is not, the procedure is blocked and an error message is outputed.
